This is a TensorFlow implementation of DDP-GCN in the following paper: .
Our codes are mostly built upon the codes of https://github.com/VeritasYin/STGCN_IJCAI-18.

## Requirements
Our code is based on Python3. There are a few dependencies to run the code. We list the major libraries as below.
* tensorflow >= 1.9.0
* numpy >= 1.15
* pandas >= 0.23
* scipy >= 1.1.0

Dependency can be installed using the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
We provide the raw dataset in https://github.com/snu-adsl/ddpgcn-dataset.
### Graph construction
We defined three types of weighted graphs based on the distances and the direction among the link vectors in the traffic network.
For each graph, adjacency matrix W can be computed as below.

We provide the pre-defined weighted graphs in dataset directory.
Individual files in a repository are limited to a 100MB maximum size limit, we zip speed files. Please unzip the files when you use the speed data.

### Dataset pre-processing
Similar with the previous studies, we normalize the input data by z-score method.

## Model training
We provide the default hyperparamter setups for DDP-GCN(Single), DDP-GCN(Parallel), and DDP-GCN(Stacked) in model-Urban1.json.
The results are also available at output directory.
